## 📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN NOTES

### Breakpoint Behavior

```
MOBILE (< 768px):
- Typography scales down 40%
- Single column layouts
- Simplified graphics (fewer particles)
- Reduced animation complexity
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Larger tap targets (44px min)

TABLET (768px - 1024px):
- Typography scales down 25%
- 2-column grids where appropriate
- Moderate graphics
- Full animations
- Hover states work

DESKTOP (> 1024px):
- Full typography scale
- Multi-column layouts (up to 4)
- All graphic elements
- Complex animations
- Parallax effects
- Cursor effects
```
